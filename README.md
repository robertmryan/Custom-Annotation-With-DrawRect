### Custom Annotation View with drawRect method  

--

This is an demonstration of a custom `MKAnnotationView` subclass that is using a custom `drawRect` method.

This is for illustrative purposes only.

Developed in Xcode 6.3 for iOS 8.3. Short of the use of `UIAlertController` alert, this should be compatible
with earlier iOS versions, too. The `MKAnnotationView` subclass should be backwards compatible.
